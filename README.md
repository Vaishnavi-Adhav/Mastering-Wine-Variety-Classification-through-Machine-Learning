a) Problem Statement: The objective is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify the type or variety of wine based on various attributes and features associated with each wine. The target variable for the classification is the 'variety' column, which contains the specific wine varieties, such as 'Chardonnay', 'Pinot Noir', 'Cabernet Sauvignon', and others.
Significance:
• Classifying wine varieties can be beneficial for organizing and categorizing a large collection of wines in databases or wine cellars.
• Can be used in wine recommendation systems to suggest wines to consumers based on their preferences.
• Can be used to educate consumers about the different types of wines available and help them make more informed choices when purchasing wines, matching wines with their preferences, and exploring new varieties.
• Understanding popularity of wine varieties can be crucial for market analysis, allowing wine producers and sellers to identify trends and make informed decisions about their product offerings and marketing strategies.
